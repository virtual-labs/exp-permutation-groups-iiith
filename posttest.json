      "question": "For a set $X={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}$ and its permutation $Y=(4,2,1,3,6,5,8,7)$, which is the longest cyclic permutation in $Y$?",

        "d": "none of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not a valid cycle in the permutation as 2 is not part of the same cycle as 1,3 and 4.",
        "b": "Correct! Following the permutation, 4→1→3→4 forms a cycle of length 3, which is the longest cycle in Y.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While (8,7) is a valid cycle, it has length 2 which is smaller than the length 3 cycle (4,1,3).",

        "d": "none of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This underestimates the number of cycles - there are more than just 2 cycles in the permutation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While close, this misses one cycle in the counting of all cycles including 1-cycles.",
        "c": "Correct! The cycles are: (4,1,3), (2), (6,5), (8,7), and (7,8), totaling 5 cycles.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The permutation has exactly 5 cycles when counting all cycles including 1-cycles."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This would imply fewer unsolvable instances than solvable ones.",
        "b": "Correct! There are equal numbers of even and odd parity permutations for any set, so the number of unsolvable instances equals the number of solvable ones.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would imply twice as many unsolvable instances as solvable ones.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option b is correct as there are equal numbers of solvable and unsolvable instances."

        "a": "true",
        "b": "false"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. When decomposed into 2-cycles, this permutation requires an even number of transpositions.",
        "b": "Correct! The permutation can be written as a product of (4,1,3)(6,5)(8,7), which decomposes into an even number of 2-cycles."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. If the order was 3, we would have x³=ε (identity), which contradicts x⁴=x.",
        "b": "Correct! Since x⁴=x, we have x³=ε (identity), making 3 the order of x.",
        "c": "Incorrect. If the order was 5, x⁵ would equal ε (identity), not a.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The order is clearly 4 as x⁴=x implies x³=ε."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While this uses 2-cycles, it doesn't preserve the original permutation's action.",
        "b": "Correct! This decomposition into 2-cycles correctly represents both cycles (1,4,2) and (3,5,6,7) while preserving their action.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This reverses the order of the second cycle which changes the permutation.",

        "c": "5",
        "d": "6"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A 5-cycle alone requires 4 2-cycles, and we still need to account for (6,7).",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would only cover the 5-cycle but not the additional 2-cycle (6,7).",
        "c": "Correct! We need 4 2-cycles for the 5-cycle plus 1 more for (6,7), totaling 5 2-cycles.",

        "a": "Incorrect. $(p^2)^3 = p^6$ which is not the identity for this cycle structure.",
        "b": "Correct! $(p^2)^3 = p^6$, and since the cycles have lengths 3 and 4, $p^{12}$ is the identity, so $p^6$ is not identity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would be equivalent to $p^3$, not $(p^2)^3 = p^6$.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The composition creates a cycle of length 6, not 12.",
        "b": "Correct! The composition α∘β=(1,3,5,4,2) is a 5-cycle, and β moves 5, creating a permutation of order 15.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 20 is too large for the order of this composition.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "The puzzle is always solvable",
        "b": "The puzzle is never solvable",
        "c": "Solvability depends on the number of inversions",
        "d": "Need more information to determine solvability"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. An odd parity with empty space in even position makes the puzzle unsolvable.",
        "b": "Correct! When the empty space is in an even position, the permutation must have even parity to be solvable.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The number of inversions determines the parity, which we already know is odd.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The composition results in an odd number of 2-cycles.",
        "b": "Correct! Each 3-cycle contributes 2 2-cycles and each 2-cycle contributes 1, making the total odd after composition.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The sign of a composition is independent of the order of composition.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The sign can be determined by counting the 2-cycles in each permutation and their composition."
