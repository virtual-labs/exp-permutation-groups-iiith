      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not a valid permutation as 3 appears twice and some elements are missing.",

        "c": "Correct! The order is the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths: LCM(3,2) = 6.",

        "a": "Incorrect. Two 2-cycles are not sufficient to represent this 4-cycle.",
        "b": "Correct! The permutation can be written as (1,2)(2,3)(3,4), requiring exactly 3 2-cycles.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Using 4 2-cycles would be more than necessary.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 5 2-cycles would be excessive and give a different permutation."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The order is LCM(2,3,4) = 12, as we need the least number that makes all cycles return to identity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 24 is larger than necessary for these cycles to return to identity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 4 would only account for the longest cycle length.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Following the composition from right to left: β moves 2→3→4, then α moves 3→1, resulting in (1,3,4,2).",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would be the result if we composed from left to right instead of right to left.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This doesn't follow the correct composition order of the permutations.",

        "a": "Incorrect. A 5-cycle requires 4 2-cycles, and a 2-cycle is 1 more, totaling 5 2-cycles.",
        "b": "Correct! A 5-cycle can be written as 4 2-cycles, and (6,7) adds 1 more, making 5 total 2-cycles, thus odd.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The parity can be determined by counting the number of 2-cycles needed.",

        "a": "Because the grid is too small",

        "d": "Because some numbers are too far from their target position"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The size of the grid doesn't determine solvability.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The empty space position alone doesn't determine solvability.",
        "c": "Correct! The solvability depends on the parity of the permutation - if odd parity with empty space in certain positions, it's unsolvable.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The distance of numbers from their target positions doesn't affect solvability."
